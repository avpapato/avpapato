Hello there, my name is Anastasia! I am a 2020 Arcadia University Computer Science alum currently living in the Greater Philadelphia area.

Iâ€™m interested in refining my Java skills with new and interesting projects, and venturing into new programming languages here and there. 

You can reach me at anapapato16@yahoo.com for any inquiries, or view my LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/anapapato/.
